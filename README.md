## Abstract
We know that modern scientific research isn’t possible without software, from short, thrown-together temporary scripts and the abundance of complex spreadsheets, through to the huge software enterprises. But how much of it do we understand from a professional services viewpoint? And where does software fit in the growing requirement to share research outputs?

This talk will explore the role software plays in supporting world-leading research, and as itself a first-class research output. We will introduce the principles of reproducible research and open science, and explore how we can support the research software development process to maximise the impact and long-term sustainability of research. This non-technical talk is ideally suited to teams who support research, e.g. in preparing grant applications, providing technical support for researchers, and those capturing research impact.

- <a href="https://data.ncl.ac.uk" target="_blank">data.ncl</a> is a <a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/rdm/sharing/datancl/" target="_blank">repository</a> where researchers can document, archive and publish datasets, where there isn’t a funder specified or discipline specific facility in place. The repository will make research data discoverable, which will promote reuse, track impact and potentially lead to new collaborations. Data deposited will be preserved for at least 10 years and in most cases openly accessed. 
- <a href="https://www.incf.org/activities/standards-and-best-practices/what-is-fair" target="_blank">FAIR Principles</a>: The FAIR principles are a set of community-developed guidelines to ensure that data or any digital object are Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. The FAIR principles specifically emphasize enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use data or any digital object, and support its reuse by individuals. Standards for the description, interoperability, citation etc. are at the core of these principles.
